Simon-Game is a classic memory game that challenges players to follow a pattern of sequences that progressively become more difficult. The game is designed to test and improve the player's memory and pattern recognition skills.

## How to Play

The game will present a sequence of colors, starting with just one color.

The player must repeat the sequence by clicking or pressing the corresponding color buttons.

After successfully repeating the sequence, the game will add an additional color to the original sequence.

The player must continue to repeat the entire sequence correctly, including the new color.

The game will keep adding new colors to the sequence, making it more challenging as the player progresses.

If the player makes a mistake and fails to repeat the correct sequence, the game will end.

The player can then choose to start a new game and try to beat their previous high score.

## Features

Gameplay: The game presents a visual sequence of colors and allows the player to repeat the sequence by interacting with color buttons.

Progressive Difficulty: The game gradually increases the difficulty by adding new colors to the sequence, testing the player's memory and ability to recall the pattern.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:
